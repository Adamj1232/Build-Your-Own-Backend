# Build-Your-Own-Backend

## Website Details
Built to practice creating and formatting a backend with Node, PostgresSQL, Express. The endpoint give data on over 3200 music venues throughout the US for bands to connect with. The data can be connected with through multiple endpoints as well as deleted and updated.

Try [BYOB](https://b-y-o-b.herokuapp.com/api/v1/venues/all) this returns all venues in system

## Reflection
  - This project was a 1 person project and our first project to create and format a backend server.  
  - I set out create a RESTful api that allows users to receive and manipulate data at those endpoints
  - I used Node, Express and 3 SQL tables to store states, cities and venues.
  - I had a job interview a couple days into this project that only and preparing for that interview, which was my first put me really far behind so I really struggled to catch up throughout the week
